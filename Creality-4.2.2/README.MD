Naming conventions used:

  If using color LCD (V2 style), the firmware will have COLORLCD in the name,
otherwise it will not.
  If using BLTOUCH, it will have BLTOUCH in the name.  If you have the BLTouch two pin connector connected to your ZMin port, use the one with ZMIN in the name.  

Example:
firmware_E400XL_CREALITY_422_COLORLCD_BLTOUCH_ZMIN.bin
- 400 XL for Creality 4.2.2 board with Color LCD and the BLTouch plugged into Zmin port.

For the LCD Screen on V2 printers you need to download the DWIN_SET.zip file and unzip it to an sdcard, remove the back of the lcd cover, and insert the sd card into the slot then power on your printer.  The screen will turn blue then orange/red, turn off the printer, remove the LCD and put the cover back on, etc.
