Compiled for Creality Ender S1 board.

We have decided to discontinue providing our own firmware for the Ender 3V2 and Ender S1.  

Please follow this link to the "Professional Firmware" resource page.  This is maintained by Miguel Risco-Castillo.  The firmware supports an enhanced set of features including the ability to set the physical printer dimensions from the LCD screen (Advanced Physical Settings)

Scroll to the bottom of the above link and look for a list of Firmware files.  Read the release notes for more information.  Essentially if you have a BLTouch or CRTouch you probably want to go with the BLT variant.  if you do not, then select the non BLT variant.
